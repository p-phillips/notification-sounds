Sounds for zulip notifications 

## Intro
A discussion on the zulip github repo about different notification sounds lead to me agreeing to curate some open source/free sounds which can be used in the forthcoming functionality which will allow a zulip user to select their own sounds.

I've indicated the license in parantheses.
